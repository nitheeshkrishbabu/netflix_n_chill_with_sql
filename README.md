## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (Movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for Movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

- **Dataset Link:** [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Schema

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix_data
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(8),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(150),
    director     VARCHAR(210),
    casts        VARCHAR(1000),
    country      VARCHAR(150),
    date_added   VARCHAR(50),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(10),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(100),
    description  VARCHAR(250)
);
```

## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
select 
	type, 
	count(distinct show_id) as total_content
from netflix_data
group by type;
```

**Objective:** Determine the distribution of content types on Netflix.

### 2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

```sql
--- With SubQueries

select 
	type, 
	rating, 
	most_common_rating
	from
(
		select *,
		rank() over(partition by type order by most_common_rating desc) as ranks
	from
	(
		select 
			type,rating,
			count(rating) as most_common_rating
		from netflix_data
		where rating is not null
		group by type,rating
	) as x) as y where ranks =1;

-- With CTE

WITH common_rating as
(
	select 
		type,
		rating,
		count(rating) as most_common_rating,
		rank() over(partition by type order by count(rating) desc) as ranks
	from netflix_data
	where rating is not null
	group by type,rating
	order by 1
)

select 
	type,
	rating
from common_rating
where ranks = 1;
```

**Objective:** Identify the most frequently occurring rating for each type of content.

### 3. List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)

```

**Objective:** Retrieve all movies released in a specific year.

### 4. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix

```sql
select
	trim(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ','))) as countries,
	count(1) as most_content
from netflix_data
group by 1
order by 2 desc
limit 5;
```

**Objective:** Identify the top 5 countries with the highest number of content items.

### 5. Identify the Longest Movie

```sql
select * from netflix_data
where
	duration = (select max(duration) from netflix_data
				where type in('Movie'));
```

**Objective:** Find the movie with the longest duration.

### 6. Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years

```sql
select 
	*
from netflix_data
where 
	TO_DATE(date_added, 'MONTH DD, YYYY')>= current_date - INTERVAl '5 years';
```

**Objective:** Retrieve content added to Netflix in the last 5 years.

### 7. Find All Movies/TV Shows by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

```sql
-- Using 'ILike' operator:

select 
	* 
from netflix_data
where director ILIKE '%Rajiv Chilaka%';

-- Using UNNEST, STRING_TO_ARRAY, TRIM and SubQueries:

select * from
(
	select 
		*,
		trim(valuee) as directors from
	(
		select *,
			UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(director,',')) as valuee
		from netflix_data
	) as x
) as y 
where directors ='Rajiv Chilaka';
```

**Objective:** List all content directed by 'Rajiv Chilaka'.

### 8. List All TV Shows with More Than 5 Seasons

```sql
select * from
(
	select 
		* 
	from netflix_data
	where duration ~* 'Seasons' -- '~* same as ILIKE'
	AND
	cast(regexp_replace(duration, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS INTEGER) > 5
) as a 
where type = 'TV Show';
```

**Objective:** Identify TV shows with more than 5 seasons.

### 9. Count the Number of Content Items in Each Genre

```sql
select 
	count(show_id) as no_of_content,
	trim(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in,','))) as genre
